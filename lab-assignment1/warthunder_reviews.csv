76561199663915703,3/1/2026,"Got a new plane loaded up a battle flew it into combat. someone starts a fight with me and my plane burns down before i fire a single round.

10/10 experience"
76561199417655949,3/1/2026,"I suck at this game, thus it is a bad game."
76561198108821258,3/1/2026,NO ABSOLUTE NO! The grind itself is very hard. You want the good stuff? Painfully grind the whole thing just to enjoy playing.
76561198755284286,3/1/2026,hard but fun
76561199021100741,3/1/2026,I like tanks.
76561199804184427,3/1/2026,plane
76561199189211645,3/1/2026,war thunder just became one of the best games for me
76561198281728116,3/1/2026,the game is tufff
76561198877879250,3/1/2026,"I do not recommend this in any way to anyone who hasn't touched this game before, stay far away.

This game is so versatile and not in a positive way, missiles are inconsistent, radar is inconsistent, planes are inconsistent. EVERYTHING IN THIS GAME WILL CHANGE FROM MATCH TO MATCH.

It's just pure luck at this point and the developers seem to have no priority other than to pump out updates that will break the game further.
Not only that but they push premium vehicles in your face till you buy them, making them seem great on paper but yet when you use them in such a way, you get no where.

The current matchmaking at top tier just consists of either an SU-30 or an F-14 just spamming missiles at you if you manage to evade those missiles, congrats.
The F-2 is now closing on your position, good luck.

Save your money, save your time, save your energy into a company that actually values you as a committed player instead of throwing dung in your face every time you try and show them the tiniest form of appreciation."
76561198256397520,3/1/2026,"Great game that brings the reality of vehicle warfare (getting oneshot from a mile away or get spawn-bombed). Having 1000+ hrs of suffering on Asia server from a country with lagspikes frequent and sereve enough to kick you out of the match, I can tell you that much.
[b]Pros:[/b]  
- Non-existent skill cap. Lots of progression, tons of vehicles (literally) and you have to learn everything when you buy a new one.
- Arguably the most accurate warfare vehicle simulation right now, not too e-sporty although their e-sport scene is quite cool too.
- Arcade for fun(?) and fast match, realistic to hone your skills, simulation battle is for those who mastered the dark art.
- Free(?) to play, and having all armored, navy, and aerial gameplay in a single package is good. But I do hope we have combined mode featuring all 3 soon, maybe in 10 years. 
[b]Cons:[/b] 
- More servers and cross-server play would help this game so much. Or maybe make sure the server is good and robust enough to prevent lagspike from kicking players (me) out of the match and wasting my 150% exp boost.
- Progression is f**ked. EVERY vehicle needs to be researched for the most basic techs AGAIN on purchase, that uses exp, which is earned from playing matches with THAT vehicle. Which means suffering on a slow-ass hunk of steel with no penetration whatsoever. Oh, exp transfer you say? That ♥♥♥♥ is paywalled, or should I say, pay-well-ed, since the cost is based on the amount of 'premium' exp that you want to use, which turns it into a literal well for you to throw money into. Having said all that, don't get me started on the farm currency (SL) debacle.
- Premium vehicles. That can sometimes be OP on their BR. Yeah but it's not so bad. 
- Non-existent skill cap, which means you can still be dunked on even with 1k, or 10k hrs.

So YEAH, if you think you can enjoy the game with all that ♥♥♥♥, then it's free, try it."
76561199297399002,3/1/2026,good
76561199825938109,3/1/2026,"Super fun when you learn it, GREAT game and once you unlock missiles and the modern planes its even cooler."
76561199388882852,3/1/2026,I hate research point
76561199802644743,3/1/2026,I mean it's alr but it takes so long to grind and everything is so expensive but it is fun and nice becuase there is a lot to do but it get's boring in a few day's.
76561199346713210,3/1/2026,nicegame
76561198059305382,3/1/2026,Y'all know darn well why I won't recommend this game
76561198743634214,3/1/2026,amazing
76561198738095114,3/1/2026,"Honestly a great game. Naval battles are pretty mid, but aviation and ground battles are super fun. Honestly a great all rounder unlike some games that just specialise in one format, but this one changes that.

Great game. Cant wait to get to jet fighters then i can play top gun music and lock in heh"
76561199532074289,3/1/2026,This game will kill your sanity
76561199221109169,3/1/2026,"I'd give it a 5/10 for all the lobotomites you get for teamates per match, like how blind can you be when he's right up your ass and you're looking at a tiger thats halfway across the map. But lord Gaijin blessed me with 10 wonderous matches with and even letting me win with 500 boosters on so it get a solid 9/10 <3"
76561199522065378,3/1/2026,"The game seems fun but if you dont have skills like most of players that have 2k hours then i dont recommend, new players are food for older players you will simply die over and over."
76561198776115468,3/1/2026,very good game would recomend
76561197996852477,3/1/2026,nothing like trying to shoot down a griphen with a ww1 biplane
76561199096240182,3/1/2026,war thunder
76561199792882107,3/1/2026,"An incredibly detailed combined arms experience that lets you take tanks, planes, and ships into battle — just be prepared for a grind that could outlast several real-world wars"
76561199018523696,3/1/2026,dont download
76561199563823284,3/1/2026,mid ahh game never play fr

76561198000121870,3/1/2026,pretty fun so far and the control's aren't hard to learn.
76561199260351523,3/1/2026,i regret playing this game because it keep crashing
76561199770772116,3/1/2026,just got this game back from steam but the grind is real. 30 hours off of steam and only about 1/4 thru usa tree
76561198743318411,3/1/2026,eee
76561199232652885,3/1/2026,playing this game is worse than being sent to hell for all of eternity.
76561199455267489,3/1/2026,AMAZING (that's all I have to say)
76561198113592313,3/1/2026,"I have never seen more aggressive and scummy monetization in my entire life. It likes like toward the later game vehicles its a requirement to pay and even that's not enough with how grindy it is, genuinely why design the game like this? Just make it pay to play at this point and make the grind actually enjoyable."
76561198292496500,3/1/2026,"best game of all time, the aviation is super fun and i like how you can play in different countries. also the tanks are super fun."
76561199013879637,3/1/2026,this game is so terrible
76561198097367938,3/1/2026,Not worth the time wasted

76561198736937759,3/1/2026,9 hours in i hope it doesn't become a addiction
76561199225803469,3/1/2026,always has server issues
76561198083794875,3/1/2026,10/10 LGIO
76561198758727378,3/1/2026,I love to spend my money on tanks just to get wiped by a Tiger. Thank you War Thunder :]
76561198011168167,3/1/2026,Fun game but just a huge grind
76561199833381302,3/1/2026,PLANE GO BOMB BOMB TAANK CREW DIES 10/10
76561198364834195,3/1/2026,DONT LISTEN TO MY STEAM HOURS I HAVE 600 HOURS OFF STEAM AND GAJINN WONT OPEN ACCOUNT TRANSFERS SO IM STUCK USING THE QUICK LAUNCHER NOT THE STEAM VARIENT. other than that this game is so painful i hate it so much its taken my soul
76561198175496910,3/1/2026,Pay money or lose. Garbage match balance in terms of vehicle ratings and stats. Likely actively pushes you to fight higher ranks to force you to pay money.
76561198211290301,3/1/2026,and here i thought crossout was paid to win this game is next level paid to win ive ever seen
76561198403584538,3/1/2026,I wasted my life on this game.
76561199538829300,3/1/2026,"it's amazing, beautiful, and absolutely one of the best games i have played, i love war games"
76561199058301837,3/1/2026,I LOVE IT
76561199374293345,3/1/2026,"I ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ HATE This game,
Would recommend"
76561199649008536,2/28/2026,Its not that good bro.........
76561198214248879,2/28/2026,"honestly, game is fun until matchmaking kicks in. You have one really good game then it decides you can carry an entire team through the next 76 matches. 

Outside of that, honestly its not bad at all. I love the feel, I love the different game modes.  

6/9 Give it a try."
76561198373233189,2/28/2026,"The gameplay is fun and every thing, but the main problem the game has other the the pay-to-win stuff, is the fact that even if your on the correct severs it still acts like the severs are on the other side of the planet and it makes no sense."
76561199482248317,2/28/2026,planes make my tism happy
76561198409894807,2/28/2026,extreme balancing issues aswell as being almost completely pay to win.
76561198020615744,2/28/2026,IDK BRO ITS FUN OK
76561199060660682,2/28/2026,idk
76561199683163517,2/28/2026,this game is awesome. btw i open to the updater so i can log in to my gajin account so it only says 3 hrs. i actually have like 70-80 probably
76561199855315709,2/28/2026,"i know it says i have 4 hours but used to play not on steam so its closer to 1,000. I fell out of addiction to this game and every time i try and play it i quit after a match because most of the time it just isn't enjoyable unless you're playing with a friend."
76561199495429987,2/28/2026,"jews fund this game so its ass, making israel the most biased nation ever. this game is goyslop"
76561198737639812,2/28/2026,its pretty fun and overall its good but the pay to win elements piss me off.
76561199468695115,2/28/2026,yes
76561199588642240,2/28/2026,it is fun
76561198415763252,2/28/2026,not fun
76561198956893479,2/28/2026,its ok i guess
76561198988016137,2/28/2026,..
76561199467558258,2/28/2026,give your life to the snail :)
76561198799704925,2/28/2026,Game has not changed in the slightest since I last played in 2020 and unlocked the Tiger. Progression is too slow and you get punished hard by other players camping across the map in the Tank game-modes with camo that you cannot get without golden eagles. Game is pay to win and I would rather play anything else.
76561197994487301,2/28/2026,"So far so good, has been fun to play with the kids.  Will update when I get more time in!"

76561198844197725,2/28/2026,I love being gaijin prisoner :D

76561199161962647,2/28/2026,i love the snail
76561199866049205,2/28/2026,If you like hating russian's this game is for you
76561199258906532,2/28/2026,gówno w chuj
76561199083414895,2/28/2026,Completely and utterly awful. Do not subject yourself to this. It is actually awful torture and garbage.
76561199587665106,2/28/2026,i like to suffer
76561199159885907,2/28/2026,"Very fun with friends, playing alone can get boring after a while. For sure a good game but beware of the grind. Find a good squadron and relax and enjoy the friendships you will make."
76561199030693322,2/28/2026,I hate this game and everything it stands for. I would rather climb into a wood chipper than play another minute of this.
76561198757865342,2/28/2026,67
76561198864127652,2/28/2026,It becomes fun when you start unlocking top-tier jets.
76561199765570018,2/28/2026,Good
76561199575498813,2/28/2026,good game but kinda overmotized and also fun i recomend it
